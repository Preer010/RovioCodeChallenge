# RovioCodeChallenge
 
I havent been using unity in a while, so my first challenge was just to get used with the engine again. After that I looked through the different subjects that was talked about in the interview and thought of ways to implement them into the project. I didnt have any experience with the areas before such as Addressables, Dependency Injection and only small knowlege of th SOLID principles.

It was a bit tough at first to figure out how to use the SOLID principles with Unity's workflow. For example, where should I draw the line between for the single responsibility principle to not overload the amount of scripts.

There were some issues when I tried to use a dependency injection framework, but I eventually figured out the different problems that I encountered.

My last challenge was to implement Addressables, at first it went very smooth and easy. But then when I built the project, they acted differently. It was my async handle that acted different in the build than in the editor and fixed that issue.
