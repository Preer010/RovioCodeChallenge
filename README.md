# RovioCodeChallenge
 
I havent been using unity in a while, so my first challenge was just to get used with the engine again. After that I looked through the different subjects that was talked about in the interview and thought of ways to implement them into the project. 

It was a bit tough at first to figure out how to use the SOLID principles with Unity's workflow. For example, where should I draw the line between for the single responsibility principle to not overload the amount of scripts.

I have never used any dependency injection frameworks before but decided to try it out to learn some more about it. I struggled for a bit because I couldn't Inject during runtime.
